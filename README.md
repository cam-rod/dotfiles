# Cam's Dotfiles

This has existed in a number of different formats (USB stick, Google Drive, private Gist), but it seemed time to finally sort this out properly.

I haven't put any work into making this easy to setup, so no guarantees are made. If you start with [devtools.sh](./linux_pkgs/devtools.sh), then the other scripts in [linux_pkgs](./linux_pkgs/), and then the [bash](./bash/) directory, it _should_ be mostly functional.
